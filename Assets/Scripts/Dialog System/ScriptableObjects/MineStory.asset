  - Welcome!
  - "Once upon a time, there was a village located in Sivas, Turkey, which  called
    Alt\u0131nl\u0131 for the village with gold"
  - The village was called that because of a story of a gold mine in there
  - "According to the elders of Alt\u0131nl\u0131, this cave had tons of gold in
    it and whoever enters the mine and mines the gold has been cursed, and cursed
    the entire village within themselves."
  - No one knows where the mine is and the accuracy of the legend is unclear
  - As a treasure hunter, you have found a map that has the entrance of this secret
    mine
  - Your goal is to find the mine and collect the gold as much as possible
  - "While doing that, you will be staying in Alt\u0131nl\u0131 village, and figure
    out why it is called a cursed mine."
